# NodesJS

## Development

- npx live-server
- npx tsc -w

## TODO

- more shape primitives
- design
- node properties
- workspaces, tabs
- visual links between nodes
- dragging
- floating menus
- side menu for various controls/debugging
- serialization
- zoom to cursor
- repeating tiled background
- dynamic sizes that are limited to outer container
- for now container objects should not have a complex "flex like" positions, but should be set in a vertical/horizontal grids
